I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate with over seven years of research experience in computer vision and machine learning. My research centers on enhancing the generalization of machine learning models to unseen domains, with applications spanning anomaly detection, biometrics, healthcare, visual perception tasks, and scene understanding. Currently, I am focused on advancing multi-modal foundation models and exploring their ability to generalize across novel domains.

- ðŸ’¬ Don't hesitate to email me if you're interested in discussing further.
