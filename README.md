I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student with over six years of research experience in computer vision and machine learning. My research goal revolves around developing generalizable machine learning models for real-world and out-of-distribution scenarios. I am currently focused on advancing multi-modal foundation models and investigating their generalization capabilities across novel domains.
